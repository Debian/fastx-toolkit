fastx-toolkit (0.0.14-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Backwards-incompatible changes upstream:

  * Default quality is now Sanger(33) instead of Illumina (64). No need for
    "-Q33" anymore.
  
  * Disallow empty nucleotide strings: fail on FASTA/FASTX files with empty
    (zero-length) nucleotide strings.  This might break old-pipelines, but
    those FASTAs are invalid anyhow and processing them should not succeed.
