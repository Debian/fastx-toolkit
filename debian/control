Description: FASTQ/A short-reads pre-processing tools
 The FASTX-Toolkit is a collection of command line tools for Short-Reads
 FASTA/FASTQ files preprocessing. Next-Generation sequencing machines usually
 produce FASTA or FASTQ files, containing multiple short-reads sequences
 (possibly with quality information). The main processing of such FASTA/FASTQ
 files is mapping (aka aligning) the sequences to reference genomes or other
 databases using specialized programs. Example of such mapping programs are:
 Blat, SHRiMP, LastZ, MAQ and many many others. However, It is sometimes more
 productive to preprocess the FASTA/FASTQ files before mapping the sequences to
 the genome - manipulating the sequences to produce better mapping results. The
 FASTX-Toolkit tools perform some of these preprocessing tasks.
